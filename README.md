# Ecommerce Customer Behavior Analysis (Tableau)

## Project Overview

This project explores customer purchasing behavior using an ecommerce dataset (2020–2023) sourced from Kaggle.  

The primary objective was to analyze behavioral patterns, customer segmentation, churn dynamics, return impact, and revenue forecasting to derive business-relevant insights.

Although the project was completed as part of a group assignment, the full analysis, dashboard design, and interpretation were executed independently.

The work focuses on analytical reasoning and business interpretation rather than visualization aesthetics.

## Key Analytical Insights

- **Core Segment:** Customers aged 25–45 represent the most active purchasing demographic.
- **Revenue Drivers:** Home and Electronics categories contribute the highest revenue.
- **Payment Behavior:** Credit Card and PayPal dominate transaction usage.
- **Churn Observation:** Active and churned customers display similar spending levels, indicating retention may be influenced more by engagement frequency than transaction size.
- **Seasonality Pattern:** Sales decline between August–November, followed by a moderate rise in December.
- **Forecast Risk Indicator:** A projected slight revenue decline by 2025 suggests the need for stronger customer retention and marketing strategies.
